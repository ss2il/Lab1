## Lab 1 : Git & GitHub for ML Projects
Hi, I am Sara Abdullah Alshahrani.

I am currently a third-year student majoring in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. I have a strong passion for exploring technology, especially in areas related to my field, such as discovering different types of vulnerabilities and learning how to handle them. I am very interested in machine learning to understand how smart devices are developed, how data is analyzed, and how artificial intelligence works.
In my free time, I enjoy watching movies with my family and playing video games.
 I am excited to gain deeper knowledge and practical applications in the field of machine learning through the ARTI 308 course.
